Survey Data Preprocessing & Translation Tool

Overview

This project streamlines the preprocessing of multilingual survey datasets by automating tasks like data cleaning, standardization, and translation. It is especially useful for preparing survey responses collected across different regions or languages, making them ready for further analysis or modeling.

⸻

Key Features
	•	Automated Cleaning: Handles missing values, inconsistent formatting, and outliers
	•	Translation: Translates survey responses from foreign language to English (or vice versa) using pre-trained language models or APIs
	•	Standardization: Normalizes scales (e.g., Likert), renames columns, and enforces schema consistency
	•	Output-Ready Format: Saves cleaned and translated data in .csv or .xlsx for analysis or dashboard integration

⸻

Technologies Used
	•	Python (Pandas, NumPy)
	•	Google Translate API / DeepL / OpenAI (for translation)
	•	Jupyter Notebook
	•	VS Code

⸻

How It Works
	1.	Upload the raw survey data (.csv, .xlsx)
	2.	Run the preprocessing script:
	•	Cleans up nulls, extra whitespace, invalid values
	•	Translates open-ended text responses
	•	Standardizes column names and formats
	3.	Download the clean, ready-to-analyze dataset

Example Use Case

You conducted a survey in both the Philippines and Latin America, with responses in English, Spanish, and Tagalog. Before any analysis, this tool:
	•	Cleans the mess
	•	Translates all responses to a common language
	•	Exports an analytics-ready dataset

Open survey_preprocessor.ipynb and follow the steps inside.

⸻

Future Enhancements
	•	GUI version using Streamlit
	•	Add more language support (e.g., Tagalog, Portuguese)
	•	Integration with Google Forms / Typeform export APIs
	•	Auto-detect language before translation
